# Provisioning and deploying HAO with `Contributor` role

This guide shows the steps needed to provision and deploy the vanilla version of the Healthcare Agent Orchestrator having limited permissions. For the instructions, the guide assumes the Developer deploying the code has `Contributor` and `Storage Blob Contributor` scoped to the target Resource Group. The Cloud team must have `Owner` or `User Access Administrator` for creating Role Assignments.

Provisioning and deployment of the code is split into 3 phases: 
- *General provisioning*, done by the Developer
- *Role assignment creation*, done by the Cloud team;
- *Post-provisioning and Deployment*, done by the Developer.

## Steps:

1. Search for `roleAssignments` in the `infra` folder, and comment out all entries found. Example:
    ```bicep
    // resource AppInsightsLoggingAccess 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments@2022-04-01' = [
    //   for principal in grantAccessTo: if (!empty(principal.id)) {
    //     name: guid(principal.id, appInsights.id, monitoringMetricsPublisherRole.id)
    //     scope: appInsights
    //     properties: {
    //       roleDefinitionId: monitoringMetricsPublisherRole.id
    //       principalId: principal.id
    //       principalType: principal.type
    //     }
    //   }
    // ]
    ```
1. By default, Bicep linting does not allow unused variables, so we must add the following `bicepconfig.json` to the project root:
    ```json
    {
        "analyzers": {
            "core": {
                "rules": {
                    "no-unused-vars": {
                    "level": "off"
                    },
                    "no-unused-params": {
                    "level": "off"
                    },
                    "no-unused-existing-resources": {
                    "level": "off"
                    }
                }
                }
            }
    }
    ```
1. Follow the [Getting Started guide in main README](../README.md#getting-started) until you complete ``Step 2: Create an `azd` Environment & Set Variables``.
1. Start the provisioning step by running:
    ```
    azd provision
    ```
    - If an error occurs with the Bicep template validation, you may need to manually set some variables, such as  `AZURE_LOCATION`.

    - The script **should** end with an error like the following:
        <details>
        <summary>Post-provision hook - Permission error.</summary>
        ```

        </details>

1. Run [scripts/createRoleAssignments.sh](../scripts/createRoleAssignments.sh)
    - The script creates the same role assignments as defined in the `bicep` files, which were commented out in Step 1. of this guide.
    - The Cloud team must fill the `DEV_TEAM_PRINCIPAL_IDS` array with the principal ID of all users that should have access to the cloud resources.
        - To get a user's principal ID, run: `az ad user show --id <user@domain.com> --query id -o tsv`.
        - The `DEV_TEAM_PRINCIPAL_IDS` should look like this `DEV_TEAM_PRINCIPAL_IDS=("aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee" "ffffffff-0000-1111-2222-333333333333")`
        - The `DEV_TEAM_PRINCIPAL_IDS` will get the following roles:
            - Cognitive Services User;
            - Azure AI Developer (scoped to both AI Hub and AI Project resources);
            - Key Vault Secrets Officer;
            - Storage Blob Contributor.
    - In case the Cloud team running the script does not have access to the same `azd` environment, those following this guide must change the `HAO_RESOURCE_GROUP` variable accordingly.
        - Example: `HAO_RESOURCE_GROUP=rg-hao`
    
> [!IMPORTANT]
> When Managed Identities are created, Azure triggers the creation of a Service Principal, which may take some time until it is replicated globally. Role Assignments are only possible after the Service Principal creation has finished. See also: [Assigning a role to a new principal sometimes fails](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/troubleshooting?tabs=bicep#symptom---assigning-a-role-to-a-new-principal-sometimes-fails). 

6. Run post-provision hook:
    ```bash
    azd hooks run postprovision
    ```

    For this command, you will need the `Storage Blob Contributor` role, which was assigned to all users in `DEV_TEAM_PRINCIPAL_IDS` by the previous step.

1. Run `azd deploy` to deploy the application.

1. Follow steps 4, 5 and 6 from the [README.md](./README.md).
